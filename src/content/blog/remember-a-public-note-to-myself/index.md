> Remember the journeys left unfinished — by choice or by chance.  
> Remember the dreams of futures that never came to be.  
> Remember the rush to act… and the paralysis that followed.
>
> Remember how fleeting all of this is.  
> Remember you’ve overcome before — and you will again.  
> Remember that even the smallest act is the way forward.
>
> Remember: living is not just thinking.  
> Remember you’re fine.  
> Remember you.
>
> And then, remember no more.
>   
> Acknowledge the present experience.  
> Appreciate unconditionally.
> Act intentionally.
